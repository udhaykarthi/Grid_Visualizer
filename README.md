# Grid Algorithm Visualizer

A Java Swing application to **visualize grid-based algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and A* in real time.

---

## Features

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explore the grid level by level.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explore the grid deeply using stack.
- **A\***: Find the shortest path from start to end using a heuristic.
- **Interactive grid**:
  - **Left-click**: toggle wall.
  - **Right-click**: set start/end.
- **Animated visualization**: shows visited cells and final paths step by step.
